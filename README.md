# Finding-Restaurants-by-Geolocation-API

# Background

Google APIs is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) developed by Google which allow communication with Google Services and their integration to other services. Examples of these include Search, Gmail, Translate or Google Maps. Third-party apps can use these APIs to take advantage of or extend the functionality of the existing services.

The APIs provide functionality like analytics, machine learning as a service (the Prediction API) or access to user data (when permission to read the data is given). Another important example is an embedded Google map on a website, which can be achieved using the Static maps API,[1] Places API[2] or Google Earth API.[3]

# Goal 

Explore Google-maps APIs, read documentation, find out tools and variations.


# Findings
